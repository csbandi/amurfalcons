amurfalcons
===========

Aim of the project is to pull and process data of satellite tagged amur falcons targeting users with mobile/data connection constraints in the field.

The data of two satellite tagged amur falcons being tracking by scientists is shared with public. However the website is data intensive with results being shown on google map layout
. The challenge is when people in the field with poor connectivity tries to access, it consumes lot of data and takes time to load. The idea is to develop a webpage that does the task quickly displaying last publicly known location of falcons in text formatted_address. Hence saving time and money.
